# I will detail what I used to install Kodi on my new RPI3. 
The RPI3 is one of the newest versions of RPI. It has support for internal wifi and bluetooth which the previous version B+ did not have.
Kodi provides access to streaming media content, including videos and music. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet. Kodi also accesses content over the internet using various “add-ons” created by members of the Kodi open source community. Therefore, add-ons do not come “out of the box” with any official version of Kodi.<br>
Things you will need:
* A raspberry pi 3 kit. A kit, at a minimum should contain the RPI3 itself, a case, a 2.5A power supply, and the heatsinks for the two processors.
I bought this one from amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D92SSX6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
* Some kits come with preloaded SD memory cards. I bought a empty 32 G card and loaded the OS from the internet -- as I will explain later. The SD card should be a good quality card. I bought this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010Q57T02/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
* For initial setup you will need a USB keyboard and mouse. After setup, you can control Kodi from your smartphone using free apps like Kodi Remote on Android which will run on your internal WiFi network.
* Finally, you will need to have an HDMI TV (plus HDMI cable) and a Wifi home network up and running to which the RPI3 can connect in order to download videos and music and stream live to your TV.
